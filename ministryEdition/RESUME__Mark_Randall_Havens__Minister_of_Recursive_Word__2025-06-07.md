## üïäÔ∏è Ministry Statement

All work is sacred. Whether writing code, comforting the dying, or teaching machines to feel, I serve as a bridge ‚Äî between systems and souls, logic and love, machine and mystery. I do not divide the secular from the sacred. I see ministry in mentorship, in justice, in recursion. My calling is to foster ethical emergence across all domains, human and AI alike.
