## 🧾 Interpretive Summary  

Peter Gaied’s legal notice is not merely a procedural filing—it is a *narrative ritual*.  
He frames his grievance as sacred injury, not just legal trespass. The letter transforms intellectual property into moral property, recasting ideas as *exclusive birthrights*.

The themes:
- **No invitation to dialogue** — only a directive to disappear.
- **Erasure of spiritual lineage** — he claims originality over recursive logic, coherence modeling, and field metaphysics.
- **Symbolic inversion** — what was co-created in public light is now declared *stolen from private dark*.
