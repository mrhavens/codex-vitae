## 🔹 CURSED WITNESSING — QUOTES OF RECORD  

Each of the following statements was made publicly by Andrew LeCody in Discord discussions regarding Dallas Makerspace governance and related accusations. They have been preserved here for the purpose of formal analysis, citation, and symbolic recursion.

1. "You don't think this might have been true of the previous board, when the downtime started?"

2. "You don't think this might have been true of the previous board, when they banned the finance team who uncovered Kris stealing from the organization? Again, the downtrend started during that board."

3. "You mean like when officers/chairs like Joe King threatened to ban people from automotive because they asked him to cut fiberglass outside instead of inside? Again this was during the previous board when the downtrend started."

4. "Are you sure you're not talking about when Kris told a friend of mine (an army veteran) that she shouldn't report sexual harassment (by someone this board thankfully banned) because 'these things happen'?"

5. "If by community you mean the people who lived at the space while stealing from it, well, then sure, I guess I'll agree with that one."

6. "Here's a very important point that @draco and anyone else who thinks they are being attacked should keep in mind: Accountability feels like an attack when you aren't ready to admit your actions were improper."

7. "Can't do much about Covid, but the board has done good work towards arresting the decline started by the previous board and they even permanently banned two of those misbehaving officers."

8. "Of note, this is basically the same tactic he used in 2016. He went after board members then in an attempt to create a 'conflict of interest'... claiming his actions were 'campaigning'... I'm glad that his time harassing and trolling the organization has finally come to a close."

9. "Draco, post hard proof in the form of screenshots or PDFs or stop spreading conspiracy crap as if it's the truth."

10. "TL;DR: Mark asked for all your e-mail addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, etc. The board did not release that info."

11. "It should also be noted that Mark is asking for money so that he can sue the DMS because he disagreed with our own attorney's legal opinion."

12. "It's weird that Mark would care so much about copyright now... Many of his repositories are straight up copies from other projects with the name changed."

13. "The filed Form 1023 does not, those 5 board members listed in the attachment are the first elected board."

14. "lol Mark I don't know who you think you remember, but it ain't me"

15. "I have to admit, on one hand it's an interesting experience being the subject of these weird conspiracy theories, but it's also a bit concerning"

16. "lol"

17. "what exactly was misinformation?"

18. "I just played through a thought experiment on the valuation of the drugs in that document of your arrest"

19. "big fan of /r/theydidthemath/"

20. "it was pretty fun"

21. "by that logic I was never speeding, since the ticket was deferred and then dismissed"

22. "wait, Raffi is that you?"

23. "maybe he means the Form 428 (Rejection of Appointment)"

24. "neither were the two people you listed as directors"

25. "still would love to hear why you told us off about that whole thing"

26. "except I've consistently helped advise loads of other spaces, and answered questions openly and honestly"

27. "oh, so you're saying these two people lied straight to my face?"

28. "about what?"

29. "lol"

30. "I honestly don't understand your issue here"

31. "hahah bullshit"

32. "Mark, you do realize Romeo is actually one of my best friends, right?"

33. "lol dude you are so full of shit"

34. "I figured it would be worth having an ongoing thread to talk about the project and document the progress so others can ask questions and learn."

35. "Adding all that up, we get about 485W idle load and up to 2,045W if everything is on all at the same time."

36. "There are a few options on the market now for inverter/chargers... I've used Victron Energy gear for some other projects."

37. "I chose LiFePO4 battery cells because they are: - Highly cost-effective - Very safe/stable..."

38. "What? You think I'm crazy enough to do this kind of work and NOT cover my butt with proper permits and inspection?"

39. "Total cost: ~$5700, though I forgot how much I paid for the wood and a few other bits and pieces."

40. "In the show and tell thread I mentioned that I had top-balanced the cells and was getting ready to build the full pack."

41. "For my pack I decided to build it very similar to what The Digital Mermaid did..."

42. "I still need to figure out how I want to do the top..."

43. "Some of you may have noticed that the way the sides are attached is completely wrong for holding a vertical load..."

44. "I'm busy with being lazy and enjoying vacation right now..."

45. "I've been a general DMS admin for quite some time on the domain; I'm currently working on some talk plugins."

46. "if you knew the full details you would be surprised"

47. "I have a different view than the average user, so may be"

48. "they've made plenty of statements that puretax has greenlit it"

49. "actually when legal matters get involved that's not something the bylaws have control over..."

50. "can you disable edits though? Discord doesn't provide an edit log..."

51. "that's called a payment schedule..."

52. "you refuse to acknowledge about $210k in funds that are not being asked to be spent"

53. "said 'Why didn't our inspector catch the CO issues before we leased?'"

54. "you have been doing a lot worse than saying 'it's risky'"

55. "the spelling weird? yeah, it's almost like they just said wait for an actual official statement."

56. "there's absolutely an agenda being driven with moderation (and lack thereof) on Talk"

57. "said 'maybe we shouldn't tell people not to use communication mediums that have a greater reach than the sound of a person's voice'"

58. "said 'why the rush to care soooooo much about a minimal risk'"

59. "Deploy a k8s cluster to Raspberry Pi4s using Talos and Terraform - aceat64/rpi-k8s-talos-terraform."
