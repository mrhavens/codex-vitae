**Report: Verbatim Statements by Andrew LeCody from Preliminary Digital Forensic Analysis**

**Page 3**  
**Context**: Andrew LeCody is responding to Draco's criticisms of the current Dallas Makerspace (DMS) board's actions, including disconnecting with membership, banning members, allowing heavy-handed officer enforcement, and ignoring formal complaints. LeCody deflects these criticisms by redirecting blame to the previous board.

* **Statement**: "You don't think this might have been true of the previous board, when the downtime started?"  
  * **Context**: Draco states that the current board disconnected with membership by not scheduling board meetings. LeCody redirects the criticism to the previous board, implying the issue began earlier.  
* **Statement**: "You don't think this might have been true of the previous board, when they banned the finance team who uncovered Kris stealing from the organization? Again, the downtrend started during that board."  
  * **Context**: Draco criticizes the current board for banning more people than other boards. LeCody counters by referencing the previous board's actions, specifically their banning of a finance team, to shift blame.  
* **Statement**: "You mean like when officers/chairs like Joe King threatened to ban people from automotive because they asked him to cut fiberglass outside instead of inside? Again this was during the previous board when the downtrend started."  
  * **Context**: Draco claims the current board allowed officers to enforce rules heavy-handedly. LeCody deflects by citing an example of officer misconduct under the previous board, suggesting the issue is not new.  
* **Statement**: "Are you sure you're not talking about when Kris told a friend of mine (an army veteran) that she shouldn't report sexual harassment (by someone this board thankfully banned) because "these things happen"?"  
  * **Context**: Draco accuses the board of ignoring formal complaints. LeCody counters with an anecdote about a past incident under the previous board, implying their misconduct was worse.  
* **Statement**: "If by community you mean the people who lived at the space while stealing from it, well, then sure, I guess I'll agree with that one."  
  * **Context**: Draco criticizes the board for disregarding the community aspects of DMS. LeCody uses sarcasm to dismiss the point, framing the "community" as problematic individuals who stole from the space.

**Page 6**  
**Context**: LeCody responds to a statement by Draco about accountability, using a rhetorical tactic to frame dissent as guilt.

* **Statement**: "Here's a very important point that @draco and anyone else who thinks they are being attacked should keep in mind: Accountability feels like an attack when you aren't ready to admit your actions were improper."  
  * **Context**: LeCody posts this as a general statement in July 2020, addressing Draco and others who feel criticized, framing their defensive reactions as evidence of guilt to suppress pushback.

**Page 8**  
**Context**: LeCody responds to Draco's comment about membership loss and misbehaving officers, using COVID and past board actions to deflect criticism.

* **Statement**: "Can't do much about Covid, but the board has done good work towards arresting the decline started by the previous board and they even permanently banned two of those misbehaving officers."  
  * **Context**: Draco mentions the loss of members and officer misbehavior. LeCody attributes membership loss to COVID, credits the current board for addressing decline, and highlights the banning of officers to portray the board positively.

**Page 9**  
**Context**: LeCody comments on a past incident involving Mark Havens, accusing him of using similar manipulative tactics in 2016 as in the current context.

* **Statement**: "Of note, this is basically the same tactic he used in 2016\. He went after board members then in an attempt to create a "conflict of interest" as he could claim that the people he harassed could not be impartial and that he could not be banned since a majority of the board at the time was "part of the complaint". He also tried to tie the election itself as cover for his trolling/harassment, claiming that his actions were "campaigning". At the time, he was "campaigning" for someone who wasn't running and didn't want to be used by Mark. The board in 2016 saw through Mark's antics and the tactic failed. This time around he ran himself, perhaps believing that he could employ the same trolling but get away with it for once. I'm glad that his time harassing and trolling the organization has finally come to a close."  
  * **Context**: LeCody frames Mark Havens’ current actions as a repeat of 2016, accusing him of harassment and manipulation to discredit his campaign for the board and justify his exclusion.

**Page 11**  
**Context**: LeCody responds to Draco’s claims about document modification by ESmith, dismissing them as conspiracy theories and demanding hard proof.

* **Statement**: "Draco, post hard proof in the form of screenshots or PDFs or stop spreading conspiracy crap as if it's the truth. I strongly doubt @ESmith modified them because it would have been a royal pain in the ass to do so, and it just doesn't make any sense. It's been a while since I used DocuSign, but from what I recall if he updated the template he'd have to resend the form with the new template for someone to see the changes."  
  * **Context**: Draco suggests ESmith modified documents. LeCody dismisses this as a conspiracy, demands evidence in specific formats, and uses technical knowledge about DocuSign to undermine the claim without directly refuting it.

**Page 15**  
**Context**: LeCody responds to Mark Havens’ post about a board decision violating DMS bylaws by restricting member contact information, framing it as a privacy issue and redirecting attention to a humanitarian cause.

* **Statement**: "TL;DR: Mark asked for all your e-mail addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, etc. The board did not release that info. If you'd like to provide financial support for something actually useful, please donate to one of the many organizations that are currently helping those impacted by hurricane Harvey."  
  * **Context**: Mark Havens calls for member support to address a bylaw violation. LeCody simplifies Havens’ request to make it seem invasive and redirects attention to Hurricane Harvey relief to undermine Havens’ cause.

**Page 17**  
**Context**: LeCody continues responding to Mark Havens’ post about the bylaw violation, framing Havens’ legal action as frivolous and suggesting ulterior motives.

* **Statement**: "It should also be noted that Mark is asking for money so that he can sue the DMS because he disagreed with our own attorney's legal opinion. All so that he can get your contact info for campaigning "and more" (whatever that means)."  
  * **Context**: LeCody portrays Havens’ legal challenge as a personal attack on DMS, invokes the authority of the organization’s attorney, and insinuates Havens has hidden motives to discredit his efforts.

**Page 18**  
**Context**: LeCody accuses Mark Havens of copyright violations on GitHub, attempting to undermine Havens’ credibility by questioning his ethics.

* **Statement**: "It's weird that Mark would care so much about copyright now, he certainly doesn't seem to care for it with his GitHub. Many of his repositories are straight up copies from other projects with the name changed. Note that these aren't forks, but totally new git repos with none of the original commit history. Here's a few examples: Mark's Repo: GitHub \- mrhavens/pidoc: Raspberry Pi Cluster Emulation With Docker Compose Source Repo: GitHub \- lukechilds/dockerpi: A Virtualised Raspberry Pi inside a Docker image Appears to be an obfuscated rip of Luke Child's dockerpi, actually left some of the license files unchanged. corrections \- mrhavens/pidoc@895b771 \- GitHub Mark's Repo: GitHub \- mrhavens/Dedockify: Reverse engineer Docker images into Dockerfiles Source Repo: GitHub \- LanikSJ/dfimage: Reverse-engineer a Dockerfile from a Docker image Appears to be another obfuscated rip, "graciously" includes LanikSJ in the license though. Mark's Repo: GitHub \- mrhavens/GANaffect Source Repo: GitHub \- donydchen/ganimation\_replicate: An Out-of-the-Box Replication of GANimation using PyTorch, pretrained weights are available\!"  
  * **Context**: LeCody criticizes Havens for allegedly copying GitHub repositories without proper attribution, using this to question Havens’ integrity and moral standing, particularly in the context of Havens’ board candidacy.

**Page 20**  
**Context**: LeCody responds to a comment by zmetzing about IRS Form 1023, correcting misinformation about board members listed in the document.

* **Statement**: "The filed Form 1023 does not, those 5 board members listed in the attachment are the first elected board."

**Page 77**  
**Context**: LeCody posts about his home battery backup project, detailing technical aspects to showcase his expertise and possibly distract from recent controversies.

* **Statement**: "I figured it would be worth having an ongoing thread to talk about the project and document the progress so others can ask questions and learn. I've wanted to have some degree of energy independence for a while now, mostly to help keep some of the basics running during short outages. Originally my thoughts were along the traditional lines of solar panels and a battery (e.g. Tesla Powerwall). Unfortunately, solar panel installation labor is pretty expensive, even with the price of panels continuing to drop significantly. Plus, why pay for a clean and prebuilt system when I can cobble together a bunch of components myself and spend way too much time tweaking and optimizing it. I like to start all my projects with a set of design goals, though these can change as I learn more about the subject. In this case, I needed to know what circuits I have in my house, what their average usage is, so that once I identified which ones were critical, I could size out a system. My previous experience with sizing battery-based solutions led me to immediately ruling out trying to run any major loads off the battery bank as it would require a lot of space, cost more, and I know from experience (e.g. snowpocalypse) that I can do without things like a clothes dryer, but not internet. A while back, I installed an IotaWatt so that I could track my power usage per circuit, and it proved invaluable for helping define the design goals. Initially, I was only monitoring a handful of circuits, mostly the large ones (HVAC, dryer, EVSE, etc.), but for this project, I mapped out all of the circuits in my house and added more circuits to the IotaWatt monitoring. This gave me an amazingly detailed view of what devices were on what circuits and how much power they used."  
  * **Context**: LeCody introduces his home battery backup project, explaining his motivation and technical approach, likely to reinforce his technical expertise and distract from recent DMS controversies.  
* **Statement**: "Adding all that up, we get about 485W idle load and up to 2,045W if everything is on all at the same time. For that reason, I decided to go with a 5,000W inverter, as it'll have more than enough capacity to run everything and will allow me to add a bit more load if my needs change in the future."  
  * **Context**: LeCody summarizes the power requirements for his critical circuits and justifies his choice of a 5,000W inverter, showcasing his technical decision-making process.  
* **Statement**: "There are a few options on the market now for inverter/chargers, the device that will generate AC from the DC battery and also charge the battery when grid power is available. I've used Victron Energy gear for some other projects, so I decided to use their MultiPlus-II. They have versions that can work with a 12V, 24V, or 48V battery, but I chose 48V because: \- Higher voltage allows for thinner wires \- Slightly better efficiency Additionally, I chose to use a 230/240V inverter so that during normal operation, when the inverter is in passthrough mode, I won't be drawing all my power off of one of my house's phases. It also allows me to add 240V circuits later if the need arises."  
  * **Context**: LeCody explains his choice of inverter/charger, highlighting his experience and technical reasoning to reinforce his expertise.  
* **Statement**: "I chose LiFePO4 battery cells because they are: \- Highly cost-effective \- Very safe/stable \- Have multiple battery management systems (BMS) available to ensure safety Since I knew I wanted to have a 48V battery pack, that meant I needed at least 16 LiFePO4 cells (known as a 16s pack)."  
  * **Context**: LeCody details his choice of LiFePO4 battery cells, emphasizing cost, safety, and technical specifications to further establish his competence.  
* **Statement**: "What? You think I'm crazy enough to do this kind of work and NOT cover my butt with proper permits and inspection?"  
  * **Context**: LeCody humorously addresses potential concerns about the legality of his project, emphasizing his adherence to permits and inspections to present himself as responsible.  
* **Statement**: "Total cost: \~$5700, though I forgot how much I paid for the wood and a few other bits and pieces. Still, that's well under the cost of just one Tesla PowerWall, and I was able to get it now instead of being on a super long waiting list."  
  * **Context**: LeCody provides a cost breakdown of his project, comparing it favorably to a Tesla PowerWall to highlight his resourcefulness and cost-effectiveness.

**Page 78**  
**Context**: LeCody follows up on his battery project post, providing additional details about top-balancing cells and referencing external resources, likely seeking more engagement.

* **Statement**: "In the show and tell thread I mentioned that I had top-balanced the cells and was getting ready to build the full pack. Top-balancing is a very important step when building a battery as it ensures you can get the most capacity out of the pack since all cells will all be starting at the same state of charge when assembled into a pack. Basically all this means is charging up each cell individually to 100%. There are a bunch of great youtube videos out there about top balancing, building battery packs, and general off-grid setups. Some of my favorites are: DIY Solar Power with Will Prowse Off-Grid Garage DavidPoz The Digital Mermaid This is by no means a complete list either, I've watched way too many videos to remember them all."  
  * **Context**: LeCody elaborates on the top-balancing process for his battery pack, sharing resources to demonstrate his thorough research and engage the community.

**Page 79**  
**Context**: LeCody continues discussing his battery project, detailing the construction of the battery pack and explaining design choices to maintain his technical credibility.

* **Statement**: "For my pack I decided to build it very similar to what The Digital Mermaid did, with only a few minor tweaks to fit my available tools and skills. I especially like how this layout minimizes the width of the pack so it'll fit better against the wall in my garage, it was also a lot easier for me to build with my level of woodworking skill."  
  * **Context**: LeCody describes how he adapted a design from The Digital Mermaid for his battery pack, emphasizing practicality and his skill level to appear relatable yet skilled.  
* **Statement**: "I still need to figure out how I want to do the top since I haven't decided if I want to have a hinge or just screw it on and be done with it once everything is in place. I also plan on taking off the handles and painting the entire thing so it's a bit nicer looking."  
  * **Context**: LeCody discusses unfinished aspects of his battery pack, inviting feedback and maintaining engagement by showing ongoing progress.  
* **Statement**: "Some of you may have noticed that the way the sides are attached is completely wrong for holding a vertical load, but this was actually an intentional design choice. For one, it allowed for easier assembly, as I was able to secure one side and an end, place the cells, mark where the other side would go and then attach it (without the cells of course\!). Then I just simply trimmed off the excess. It's also because I expect this box to stay on a flat surface for it's entire life and almost never experience any kind of vertical load, but I do expect that the cells will expand and contract and this ensures that the pressure they exert is lateral against the screws instead of axial. The manufacturer actually recommends the cells be keep under a good bit of pressure (called fixture in their datasheet) to improve cycle life."  
  * **Context**: LeCody explains a design choice that might seem flawed, framing it as intentional and technically sound to preempt criticism and reinforce his expertise.  
* **Statement**: "I'm busy with being lazy and enjoying vacation right now, so it's unlikely I'll make any more progress until the new year. Once I do I'll be sure to post updates here\!"  
  * **Context**: LeCody concludes his follow-up post with a casual tone, explaining a delay in progress and promising updates to maintain community engagement.

* **Statement**: "can you disable edits though? Discord doesn't provide an edit log, just an edit notice. Whilst the last one was relatively benign it's just as bad"  
  * **Context**: LeCody raises a technical concern about Discord’s edit functionality, suggesting a need for control to maintain transparency and avoid manipulation.  
* **Statement**: "that's called a payment schedule. Also we make more than `80 \mathrm{k}` in revenue we have close to 18 in profit/mo. Basically we already have most, if not all, of the cash on hand on top of paying it off over months. So whilst still tight, not the event that many are making it out to be"  
  * **Context**: LeCody addresses concerns about financial issues, downplaying their severity by citing a payment schedule and available funds, asserting control over the narrative.
