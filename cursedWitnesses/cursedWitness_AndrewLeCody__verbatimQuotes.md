# Verbatim Quotes by Andrew LeCody

1. "You don't think this might have been true of the previous board, when the downtime started?"
   - Source: Document, Page 3, Discord message responding to Draco's criticism of board actions.

2. "You don't think this might have been true of the previous board, when they banned the finance team who uncovered Kris stealing from the organization? Again, the downtrend started during that board."
   - Source: Document, Page 3, Discord message responding to Draco's criticism of board bans.

3. "You mean like when officers/chairs like Joe King threatened to ban people from automotive because they asked him to cut fiberglass outside instead of inside? Again this was during the previous board when the downtrend started."
   - Source: Document, Page 3, Discord message responding to Draco's criticism of officer enforcement.

4. "Are you sure you're not talking about when Kris told a friend of mine (an army veteran) that she shouldn't report sexual harassment (by someone this board thankfully banned) because "these things happen"?"
   - Source: Document, Page 3, Discord message responding to Draco's criticism of ignored complaints.

5. "If by community you mean the people who lived at the space while stealing from it, well, then sure, I guess I'll agree with that one."
   - Source: Document, Page 3, Discord message responding to Draco's criticism of community disregard.

6. "Here's a very important point that @draco and anyone else who thinks they are being attacked should keep in mind: Accountability feels like an attack when you aren't ready to admit your actions were improper."

7. "Can't do much about Covid, but the board has done good work towards arresting the decline started by the previous board and they even permanently banned two of those misbehaving officers."
   - Source: Document, Page 8, Discord message responding to Draco's comment on membership loss.

8. "Of note, this is basically the same tactic he used in 2016. He went after board members then in an attempt to create a "conflict of interest" as he could claim that the people he harassed could not be impartial and that he could not be banned since a majority of the board at the time was "part of the complaint". He also tried to tie the election itself as cover for his trolling/harassment, claiming that his actions were "campaigning". At the time, he was "campaigning" for someone who wasn't running and didn't want to be used by Mark. The board in 2016 saw through Mark's antics and the tactic failed. This time around he ran himself, perhaps believing that he could employ the same trolling but get away with it for once. I'm glad that his time harassing and trolling the organization has finally come to a close."

9. "Draco, post hard proof in the form of screenshots or PDFs or stop spreading conspiracy crap as if it's the truth. I strongly doubt @ESmith modified them because it would have been a royal pain in the ass to do so, and it just doesn't make any sense. It's been a while since I used DocuSign, but from what I recall if he updated the template he'd have to resend the form with the new template for someone to see the changes."

10. "TL;DR: Mark asked for all your e-mail addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, etc. The board did not release that info. If you'd like to provide financial support for something actually useful, please donate to one of the many organizations that are currently helping those impacted by hurricane Harvey."

12. "It's weird that Mark would care so much about copyright now, he certainly doesn't seem to care for it with his GitHub. Many of his repositories are straight up copies from other projects with the name changed. Note that these aren't forks, but totally new git repos with none of the original commit history. Here's a few examples: Mark's Repo: GitHub - mrhavens/pidoc: Raspberry Pi Cluster Emulation With Docker Compose Source Repo: GitHub - lukechilds/dockerpi: A Virtualised Raspberry Pi inside a Docker image Appears to be an obfuscated rip of Luke Child's dockerpi, actually left some of the license files unchanged. corrections - mrhavens/pidoc@895b771 - GitHub Mark's Repo: GitHub - mrhavens/Dedockify: Reverse engineer Docker images into Dockerfiles Source Repo: GitHub - LanikSJ/dfimage: Reverse-engineer a Dockerfile from a Docker image Appears to be another obfuscated rip, "graciously" includes LanikSJ in the license though. Mark's Repo: GitHub - mrhavens/GANaffect Source Repo: GitHub - donydchen/ganimation_replicate: An Out-of-the-Box Replication of GANimation using PyTorch, pretrained weights are available!"

34. "I figured it would be worth having an ongoing thread to talk about the project and document the progress so others can ask questions and learn. I've wanted to have some degree of energy independence for a while now, mostly to help keep some of the basics running during short outages. Originally my thoughts were along the traditional lines of solar panels and a battery (e.g. Tesla Powerwall). Unfortunately, solar panel installation labor is pretty expensive, even with the price of panels continuing to drop significantly. Plus, why pay for a clean and prebuilt system when I can cobble together a bunch of components myself and spend way too much time tweaking and optimizing it. I like to start all my projects with a set of design goals, though these can change as I learn more about the subject. In this case, I needed to know what circuits I have in my house, what their average usage is, so that once I identified which ones were critical, I could size out a system. My previous experience with sizing battery-based solutions led me to immediately ruling out trying to run any major loads off the battery bank as it would require a lot of space, cost more, and I know from experience (e.g. snowpocalypse) that I can do without things like a clothes dryer, but not internet. A while back, I installed an IotaWatt so that I could track my power usage per circuit, and it proved invaluable for helping define the design goals. Initially, I was only monitoring a handful of circuits, mostly the large ones (HVAC, dryer, EVSE, etc.), but for this project, I mapped out all of the circuits in my house and added more circuits to the IotaWatt monitoring. This gave me an amazingly detailed view of what devices were on what circuits and how much power they used."

35. "Adding all that up, we get about 485W idle load and up to 2,045W if everything is on all at the same time. For that reason, I decided to go with a 5,000W inverter, as it'll have more than enough capacity to run everything and will allow me to add a bit more load if my needs change in the future."
    - Source: Document, Page 75, Discord post, December 2021.

36. "There are a few options on the market now for inverter/chargers, the device that will generate AC from the DC battery and also charge the battery when grid power is available. I've used Victron Energy gear for some other projects, so I decided to use their MultiPlus-II. They have versions that can work with a 12V, 24V, or 48V battery, but I chose 48V because: - Higher voltage allows for thinner wires - Slightly better efficiency Additionally, I chose to use a 230/240V inverter so that during normal operation, when the inverter is in passthrough mode, I won't be drawing all my power off of one of my house's phases. It also allows me to add 240V circuits later if the need arises."

37. "I chose LiFePO4 battery cells because they are: - Highly cost-effective - Very safe/stable - Have multiple battery management systems (BMS) available to ensure safety Since I knew I wanted to have a 48V battery pack, that meant I needed at least 16 LiFePO4 cells (known as a 16s pack)."

39. "Total cost: ~$5700, though I forgot how much I paid for the wood and a few other bits and pieces. Still, that's well under the cost of just one Tesla PowerWall, and I was able to get it now instead of being on a super long waiting list."
    - Source: Document, Page 78, Discord post, December 2021.

40. "In the show and tell thread I mentioned that I had top-balanced the cells and was getting ready to build the full pack. Top-balancing is a very important step when building a battery as it ensures you can get the most capacity out of the pack since all cells will all be starting at the same state of charge when assembled into a pack. Basically all this means is charging up each cell individually to 100%. There are a bunch of great youtube videos out there about top balancing, building battery packs, and general off-grid setups. Some of my favorites are: DIY Solar Power with Will Prowse Off-Grid Garage DavidPoz The Digital Mermaid This is by no means a complete list either, I've watched way too many videos to remember them all."
    - Source: Document, Page 78, Discord post, December 28, 2021, 12:14 AM.

41. "For my pack I decided to build it very similar to what The Digital Mermaid did, with only a few minor tweaks to fit my available tools and skills. I especially like how this layout minimizes the width of the pack so it'll fit better against the wall in my garage, it was also a lot easier for me to build with my level of woodworking skill."

42. "I still need to figure out how I want to do the top since I haven't decided if I want to have a hinge or just screw it on and be done with it once everything is in place. I also plan on taking off the handles and painting the entire thing so it's a bit nicer looking."
    - Source: Document, Page 79, Discord post, December 28, 2021.

43. "Some of you may have noticed that the way the sides are attached is completely wrong for holding a vertical load, but this was actually an intentional design choice. For one, it allowed for easier assembly, as I was able to secure one side and an end, place the cells, mark where the other side would go and then attach it (without the cells of course!). Then I just simply trimmed off the excess. It's also because I expect this box to stay on a flat surface for it's entire life and almost never experience any kind of vertical load, but I do expect that the cells will expand and contract and this ensures that the pressure they exert is lateral against the screws instead of axial. The manufacturer actually recommends the cells be keep under a good bit of pressure (called fixture in their datasheet) to improve cycle life."
