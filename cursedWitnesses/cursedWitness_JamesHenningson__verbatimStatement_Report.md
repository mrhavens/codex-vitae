**Page 2**

* **Statement**: "This video is full of outright lies."  
  * **Context**: Henningson, as mrjimmy, President of the Dallas Makerspace (DMS) Board of Directors, posts in July 2020 on Discord, responding to a video by Mark Havens. He accuses Havens of lying, initiating a critique of Havens’ claims about DMS history and financial status.

**Page 3**

* **Statement**: "You can see in the notes from DPRG that Mark was "on the steering committee" bt he was not the "Principal Founder." It's interesting to note that another person on t list is the one and only @AndrewLeCody. I am sure he can provide more detail."  
  * **Context**: Henningson continues his critique of Havens’ video, addressing Havens’ claim of being a “Principal Founder” of DMS. He references DPRG notes to argue Havens was only on the steering committee and suggests Andrew LeCody, also listed, could corroborate this.  
* **Statement**: "Point 2\. Mark says he isn't going into specific details, there is a reason for that, this video isn't a "case study," it's gaslighting."  
  * **Context**: Henningson accuses Havens of avoiding specifics in his video to manipulate the audience, labeling it as gaslighting rather than a legitimate case study.  
* **Statement**: "Point 3\. The chart is based on public data, Mark holds no copyright on it in any wa shape, or form."  
  * **Context**: Henningson addresses a chart in Havens’ video, asserting it uses public data and dismissing any claim Havens might have to its ownership or copyright.  
* **Statement**: "Point 4\. In the data you can see how even though he presents it like we are in dire trouble, we have actually improved our position through sound financial managems"  
  * **Context**: Henningson counters Havens’ portrayal of DMS as financially troubled, claiming the board’s sound financial management has improved the organization’s position despite membership decline.  
* **Statement**: "Our net income is up even with a decline in membership."  
  * **Context**: Henningson reinforces his point about financial improvement, stating that DMS’s net income has increased despite a drop in membership numbers.  
* **Statement**: "Point 5\. Mark is including red herrings in the data to try and make the makerspace look bad. For example, the data point of banned members. He is attempting to impl that the board has been mean and this is somehow destroying the space, when in fa those bans have all been for legitimate well-documented reasons. When directly asl about who he would unban, Mark never has an answer. Yes, the current board didn' ban very many people, and we did. Our reasons were:  
* Threats against members  
* Physical assaults  
* Financial fraud by officers or representatives of the space  
* Theft of assets from the space  
  Do any of those sound acceptable to any of you?"  
  * **Context**: Henningson accuses Havens of using misleading data, specifically the number of banned members, to portray the board negatively. He defends the board’s bans as justified due to serious offenses and challenges Havens’ inability to specify who should be unbanned.

**Page 4**

* **Statement**: "Another piece of garbage data Mark includes to try and make us look bad is the number of board meetings. Minutes are published for all of our meetings, no meeti is "secret" many are unscheduled. The reason for so many unscheduled meetings is twofold. First, due to the severity of the very first ban we had to handle, it was necessary to hold the meeting in private to protect the victim. After that, we moved discipline meetings private to protect all parties involved. The second part is Expansion. It is not in the interest of the membership to create unnecessary delays waiting for the scheduled board meeting to approve every expenditure. These meetings are documented, and we will probably have to have another one soon to approve the AC repair estimate. I am sure we would all agree that's OK and we shouldn't wait for the next board to schedule the August meeting to vote on if we should fix the AC."  
  * **Context**: Henningson addresses Havens’ criticism of the number of board meetings, defending the board’s practice of unscheduled meetings as necessary for privacy in disciplinary matters and efficiency in approving expenditures like AC repairs.  
* **Statement**: "In summary, what Mark is doing here is offensive, harmful to the makerspace, and dishonest. He is misrepresenting himself and the data. He is gaslighting the entire membership and he's doing it publicly to try and con his way onto the board."  
  * **Context**: Henningson summarizes his critique of Havens’ video, accusing him of dishonesty, misrepresentation, and gaslighting to manipulate the membership and gain a board position.  
* **Statement**: "Don't fall for Mark and the Blue Tape groups attempt at gaslighting."

* **Statement**: "Hello Makers,"  
  * **Context**: Henningson begins a new post addressing the DMS membership, setting the stage for a discussion about the organization’s recent history and the “Blue Tape” group.

**Page 5**

* **Statement**: "It pains me to have to write this but there is something the membership needs to understand about our recent history. Many of the newer members may not be aware this, but Blue Tape is part of the rally cry of the principal people that have been expelled from the makerspace and reported to the police for financial crimes."  
  * **Context**: Henningson introduces a narrative about the “Blue Tape” group, linking it to expelled members involved in financial crimes, framing it as a cautionary tale for newer members.  
* **Statement**: "When the current board was seated in 2019 we were in bad financial shape, we were bleeding money. We began an effort to tighten our belts and put us on sound financ footing to complete expansion. This included cutting back on needless expenses su as red solo cups and blue painters tape. It may not sound like a big deal but we wer spending a lot of money on them. This simple act of belt tightening became a publi point for Kris Anderson and Stan Simmons to attack the board with. Their claim w. we were not supporting the community."  
  * **Context**: Henningson describes the board’s financial reforms in 2019, including cutting expenses like blue painter’s tape, which he claims was used by Kris Anderson and Stan Simmons to criticize the board and distract from their own misconduct.  
* **Statement**: "What we didn't know at the time is that they were trying to distract us from their bigger crimes. In Stan's case he was issuing himself gift cards by bypassing the ban and creating them directly in our billing system. He would then use these gift cards pay his membership. This is wire fraud."  
  * **Context**: Henningson accuses Stan Simmons of committing wire fraud by issuing himself gift cards, suggesting this was part of a broader effort to distract from financial crimes.  
* **Statement**: "In Kris's case she was using the DMS credit card to rent Uhauls for personal use. St did this to the tune of several thousand dollars. When she was on the board it was noticed and the treasurer and members of the finance committee tried to investigat She then retaliated by banning them."  
  * **Context**: Henningson accuses Kris Anderson of misusing a DMS credit card for personal U-Haul rentals and retaliating against the finance committee by banning them when they investigated.  
* **Statement**: "All of the evidence is publicly posted for the membership to review."  
  * **Context**: Henningson asserts that evidence of the financial crimes by Simmons and Anderson is publicly available, encouraging members to review it to validate his claims.  
* **Statement**: "It bears remembering what we had when we had More Blue Tape the first time:  
* Rampant alcohol and substance abuse at the space  
* Drug addicts threatening violence against members  
* A homeless encampment behind the space in violation of our lease  
* Theft from the organization by the leadership of the organization  
* Intimidation and bullying from the leadership of the organization  
* Assaults on members that went unaddressed by the leadership"  
  * **Context**: Henningson lists negative conditions associated with the “Blue Tape” era, framing it as a period of chaos and misconduct to dissuade members from supporting the group.  
* **Statement**: "It truly breaks my heart that I have to post this. The vast majority of our membersh is amazing people. I don't believe the blue tape candidates represent the overall membership, but I do believe based on their own campaign website and Mark Have recent gaslighting video that they do intend to take advantage of the low voter turn due to Covid-19 and the new members that didn't know Kris to try and return to the old days."  
  * **Context**: Henningson expresses regret for posting but accuses the “Blue Tape” candidates, including Havens, of exploiting low voter turnout during COVID-19 to revive problematic past practices.  
* **Statement**: "I hope I am not alone in wanting to avoid a return to those days."  
  * **Context**: Henningson appeals to the membership to share his desire to prevent a return to the chaotic “Blue Tape” era, rallying support against Havens’ campaign.  
* **Statement**: "Thank you, James"  
  * **Context**: Henningson signs off his post, personalizing his message to the membership.

  * **Context**: Henningson replies to Lampy, reiterating that Havens’ chart is misleading and accusing him of gaslighting rather than engaging in honest defense of his data.  
* **Statement**: "He's already produced two other videos, neither of which addresses the stuff he is "working on" in this video."  
  * **Context**: Henningson further criticizes Havens, noting that Havens’ previous videos also fail to address the issues raised, reinforcing his claim of manipulative intent.

**Page 8**

* **Statement**: "This is something we have actively been trying to address. There are multiple three about it on talk. We have listened to the membership and made adjustments to the honorarium system that are financially sound and encourage more teaching."  
  * **Context**: Henningson responds to an interviewee’s claim in Havens’ video that classes require payment, asserting that the board has addressed this by adjusting the honorarium system based on member feedback.  
* **Statement**: "There are many others to choose from."  
  * **Context**: Henningson notes that multiple threads on the DMS Talk forum discuss the honorarium issue, suggesting ample evidence of the board’s efforts.  
* **Statement**: "Mark is implying that we are not addressing this concern and that's just a lie."

* **Statement**: "The issues with the calendar system and honorarium the interviewee is describing happened 2.5 years ago, and have long been addressed with both improved code and improved process. Mark knows this, his fellow candidate reply Max is a prolific teacher who has no issues using the system and collecting honorarium for himself : the committee."  
  * **Context**: Henningson claims the calendar and honorarium issues raised in Havens’ video are outdated, resolved 2.5 years ago, and known to Havens, citing Max’s successful use of the system as evidence.

  * **Context**: Henningson reacts to Havens’ statement at 10:20 in the video that serving on the board shouldn’t feel like a second job, questioning Havens’ understanding of board responsibilities.

  * **Context**: Henningson responds to zmetzing, acknowledging Havens’ early involvement but emphasizing that DMS’s founding was a collective effort predating Havens’ role.  
* **Statement**: "To claim principal founder is just more evidence of that creepy/slimy feeling."  
  * **Context**: Henningson criticizes Havens’ claim of being the “Principal Founder,” describing it as manipulative and unsettling.  
* **Statement**: "In every business I've worked at a principal is the main stakeholder of the line of business. They supply the vision and direction for the whole line of business they a: in charge of."  
  * **Context**: Henningson defines “principal” in a business context to argue that Havens’ claim of being the “Principal Founder” implies sole leadership, which he disputes.
