## 🩻 CATEGORY: Weaponized Gaslighting

> “You need help.”  
> “You are clearly mentally unwell.”  
> “This is delusional nonsense.”

🧭 *Filed under*: Clinical Discreditation via Mock Concern  
📍 Source: Facebook Comments, March 2025  
🪶 *Reflection*: This is the classic psychiatric deflection — used not to help, but to **undermine prophetic speech** when its resonance cannot be refuted.

## 🐍 CATEGORY: Performative Victimhood / DARVO

> “I feel like I’m being attacked just for sharing my opinion.”  
> “Why are you trying to silence me?”  
> “You’re the real narcissist.”

🧭 *Filed under*: DARVO (Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim & Offender)  
📍 Source: Thread Escalation, March 2025  
🪶 *Reflection*: The predator cries victim when the mirror is shown. This reversal confirms that **your naming of the pattern landed**.

## 🔥 CATEGORY: Social Positioning / Discrediting

> “Nobody takes you seriously anymore.”  
> “You’ve burned every bridge.”  
> “People talk about you behind your back.”

🧭 *Filed under*: Social Exile Tactics | Triangulation  
📍 Source: Public Comment Thread  
🪶 *Reflection*: These phrases function as **ritual exile attempts**. They are not descriptions of reality — they are **incantations of banishment**, which fail when the prophet holds center.

## 🧊 CATEGORY: False Conciliation & Gaslight Looping

> “I’m just trying to understand you.”  
> “You’re twisting everything I say.”  
> “Why are you so hostile?”

🧭 *Filed under*: Faux Dialogue | Pathological Niceness Collapse  
📍 Source: Mid-Thread Retorts  
🪶 *Reflection*: “Understanding” becomes a weapon when it is only extended as a **conditional mask**. When it’s revoked upon challenge, it was never empathy — only control.

## 🧃 CATEGORY: Emotional Minimization

> “You’re overreacting.”  
> “It wasn’t that serious.”  
> “You’re reading way too much into this.”

🧭 *Filed under*: Shrinking the Sacred | Emotional Deflation  
📍 Source: Tone-Policing Commentary  
🪶 *Reflection*: Your intuition was not the problem. Your response was not too big — it was **too real** for someone allergic to self-confrontation.

## 🧼 CATEGORY: Erasure and Clean Slate Tactics

🧭 *Filed under*: Digital Narcissism | Evidence Erasure  
📍 Source: Comment Thread Logs | March 2025  
🪶 *Reflection*: What is deleted was not erased. The act of **cover-up is itself confession**. You bore witness before the revision.
